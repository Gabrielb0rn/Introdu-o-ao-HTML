                <h4> THE DRIVER’S DREAM </h4>
                <p> Engineered to be the perfect driver’s car, every innovation in the CC850 is designed to enhance the driving experience.
                     The award-winning Engage Shift System (ESS) is one such innovation, providing both a gated 6-speed manual and a 9-speed automatic in the same transmission.
                      The choice isyours!</p> 
                <p>Inspired by the original CC8S, the CC850 features the classic
                    Koenigsegg silhouette, while the interior, and particularly the
                    analog chronocluster, is a work of art.</p>
